            This choropleth map displays the educational
            spending per student across Australian states and territories in
            2019. Australia's distribution of educational funding reveals <strong>stark regional inequalities</strong>, 
            with some territories receiving nearly <strong>double</strong> the investment of others.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            The <strong>Northern Territory</strong> leads with the highest spending at <strong>$28.69 per student</strong>, 
            while <strong>Victoria</strong> receives the lowest allocation at just <strong>$15.92 per student</strong>. These disparities likely reflect the additional 
            costs of delivering education in remote areas and smaller population centers.

            These bar charts compare <span class="highlight-color-numeracy">national average numeracy</span> and <span class="highlight-color-writing">writing performance</span>
            across different geographic locations. A concerning achievement gap emerges, with 
            students in <strong>major cities</strong> scoring approximately 50-60 points higher than their 
            peers in <strong>very remote areas</strong> across both subjects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            <strong>Major cities</strong> lead with mean scores of around <span class="highlight-color-numeracy">530 in numeracy</span> and 
            <span class="highlight-color-writing">505 in writing</span>, while <strong>very remote areas</strong> struggle with scores around 
            <span class="highlight-color-numeracy">470 in numeracy</span> and <span class="highlight-color-writing">445 in writing</span>. The consistent pattern 
            across both domains suggests systemic barriers—including teacher shortages, limited resources, 
            and connectivity issues—that disproportionately affect rural and remote students.

            This <strong>scatter plot</strong> examines the relationship between
            spending per student and <strong>mean NAPLAN scores</strong> across states
            and territories. The data reveals a surprising paradox: higher investment doesn't 
            guarantee better outcomes, suggesting that educational quality depends on multiple 
            factors beyond pure financial resources. Factors such as <strong>remoteness, socio-economic 
            differences, and varying access to qualified teachers</strong> can all influence student performance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            <span class="highlight-color-victoria">Victoria</span> achieves the <strong>highest mean NAPLAN score of 568.37</strong> 
            with the lowest <span class="highlight-color-spending">spending of just $15.92 per student</span>, demonstrating 
            exceptional efficiency. Meanwhile, the <span class="highlight-color-northern-territory">Northern Territory</span> invests 
            <span class="highlight-color-spending">$28.69 per student</span>—nearly 80% more—yet achieves a moderate score of 545.56. 
            This suggests factors like teaching quality, curriculum effectiveness, and socioeconomic 
            contexts may outweigh funding levels in determining student success.

            This <strong>line chart</strong> tracks school <span class="highlight-color-primary-school">attendance
            rates</span> from 2012 to 2023 across school levels. A persistent gap exists between 
            <span class="highlight-color-primary-school">primary</span> and <span class="highlight-color-secondary-school">secondary</span> students, with 
            <span class="highlight-color-primary-school">primary attendance</span> consistently maintaining around 92-93% while 
            <span class="highlight-color-secondary-school">secondary attendance</span> hovers around 87-88% throughout the period.
            Indeed, there appears to be a decline in discipline and engagement as individuals grow older, potentially reflecting 
            increased independence, social factors, and external commitments during secondary schooling.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            The <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong> (2020-2022) caused notable disruptions, with both levels 
            experiencing declines—<span class="highlight-color-primary-school">primary attendance</span> dropped to approximately 90% 
            and <span class="highlight-color-secondary-school">secondary attendance</span> fell to around 84% during 2021. The 4-5 
            percentage point gap between school levels persists across all years, suggesting that 
            engagement challenges intensify as students progress through adolescence, possibly due 
            to increased independence, work commitments, or disengagement from traditional schooling.

            This interactive time series reveals suspension patterns across age groups

            with <span class="highlight-color-male">male students</span> consistently receiving 2-3 times more 
            suspensions than <span class="highlight-color-female">female students</span>, peaking in the 13-16 years 
            age bracket where <strong>males account for approximately 75% of all suspensions</strong>. This stable pattern 
            indicates behavioral differences or potential bias in disciplinary responses.

          <p class="text-muted">
            Select different age groups to observe how suspension rates escalate dramatically 
            during adolescence—the 13-16 age group shows suspension numbers reaching <strong>over 30,000</strong> for 
            <span class="highlight-color-male">males</span> in peak years, compared to around 10,000 for 
            <span class="highlight-color-female">females</span>. The 2020-2021 period shows notable decreases 
            across all groups, likely reflecting pandemic-related school closures and remote learning, 
            with rates rebounding in 2022-2023 as students returned to in-person instruction.

            This Sankey diagram maps the flow of suspension incidents in 2013, 
            tracing how <span class="highlight-color-year-level">suspensions from different year levels</span> 
            aggregate into the total of approximately 66,000 incidents, then branch into 
            <span class="highlight-color-suspension-reason">specific behavioral categories</span>. The visualization 
            reveals which student groups and behaviors drive disciplinary actions. <span class="highlight-color-year-level">Years 9-10</span> contribute the largest share of suspensions, 
            followed by <span class="highlight-color-year-level">Years 7-8</span>, confirming that early to mid-adolescence 
            represents the peak period for disciplinary issues.

          <p class="text-muted">
            Among <span class="highlight-color-suspension-reason">behavioral causes</span>, 
            physical violence and aggressive behavior dominate as the leading reasons for suspension, 
            followed by persistent disobedience and substance-related incidents, suggesting that targeted 
            intervention programs focusing on conflict resolution and emotional regulation during the 
            transition to secondary school could significantly reduce suspension rates.
